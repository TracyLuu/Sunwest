Sunwest Bank
Jr. Front End Developer Code Challenge
Simple Landing Page Build
Be as creative as you would like to demonstrate. This request is hopefully simple and straightforward;
you should create a landing page that will optimize CTR (by element placement) with the CTA being a
form submission. The page can be as polished or as simple and strictly functional as you choose (bonus
for looking good, but we do have a designer we can utilize as needed). The most important portion is
functionality and overall layout. The form should request first name, last name, email address, phone
number, and loan amount. The form should post to https://staging.sunwestbank.com/test_form/ (You
will notice you cannot access this link, this is by design). The form should post each value as a string,
except the loan amount which should be strictly a numeric value. All fields are required. The page should
include the Sunwest Bank logo, a (fictitious) dial-in phone number, placeholder content and media
(Lorem ipsum is fine for text).

Optional Features:
- Accepting first and last name as one input and splitting into two prior to form submission
- Creating proper email and phone validation, however you choose. If included please describe how
the validation works, what it accepts and does not accept.
- Inclusion of other documents that outline your process, the design, or relevant research you
completed during the task.
- Going above and beyond in anyway, this is intentionally a blank slate with few requirements. Make
sure those requirements are met, then have fun with it!

Please provide your final web page as a single document; this means including all styles in the
document, any Javascript used, etc. - of course, you can include any libraries you choose. If you have
your own method to host files, feel free to include your css/js as inclusions instead. The file should be
able to be placed in any webserver directory and perform the requested actions (namely posting to the
endpoint).

Hint: If you are looking for ideas, the look and feel, etc. check out our website. Also, we are aware in
some ways this challenge does not follow design best practices, it is not of concern as the challenge is
meant to be a demonstration of your knowledge, not create a production ready web page.
